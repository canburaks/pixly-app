# Pixly: AI-assisted Movie Recommendation Engine

Pixly is a deprecated movie recommendation engine that uses [MovieLens data](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 
It was a learning project that opened the doors of the full-stack web development world to me. 

## Tech Stack
Pixly is a web app that is built as a single-page application. I implemented a Django backend, Numpy and Cython optimized multi-threaded intensive calculations, and MySQL with Redis supported databases. I used React with some statically generated web pages on the frontend part. I built an atomic design system with CSS and the styled-components for the project.  Also, rich data for movies and people implemented for SEO purposes. 
Also, [Pixly Blog is implemented with Svelte](https://github.com/canburaks/pixly-blog-svelte).
