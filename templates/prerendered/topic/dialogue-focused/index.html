At the end of their encounter at the Vienna train station, which is also how the book ends, they, not providing contact information to the other, vowed to meet each other again in exactly six months at that very spot. As the media scrum at the bookstore nears its conclusion, Jesse spots Celine in the crowd, she who only found out about the book when she earlier saw his photograph promoting this public appearance.

Beyond the issue of the six month meeting, what has happened in their lives in the intervening nine years, and their current lives, they once again talk about their philosophies of life and love, this time with the knowledge of their day together and how it shaped what has happened to them.","imdbRating":8.1,"tags":[{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:8638.tags.0","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:8638.tags.1","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:8638.tags.2","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:8638.tags.3","typename":"TagType"}],"__typename":"MovieType"},"MovieType:8638.tags.0":{"name":"love story","slug":"love-story","genreTag":false,"subgenreTag":true,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:8638.tags.1":{"name":"melancholy","slug":"melancholy","genreTag":false,"subgenreTag":true,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:8638.tags.2":{"name":"philosophy","slug":"philosophy","genreTag":false,"subgenreTag":true,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:8638.tags.3":{"name":"romance","slug":"romance","genreTag":true,"subgenreTag":false,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:2132":{"id":2132,"name":"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Meanwhile, in another part of town, Hortense, adopted at birth but now grown up, starts to try and trace her mother.","imdbRating":8,"tags":[{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:1041.tags.0","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:1041.tags.1","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:1041.tags.2","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:1041.tags.3","typename":"TagType"}],"__typename":"MovieType"},"MovieType:1041.tags.0":{"name":"drama","slug":"drama","genreTag":true,"subgenreTag":false,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:1041.tags.1":{"name":"family drama","slug":"family-drama","genreTag":false,"subgenreTag":true,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:1041.tags.2":{"name":"golden palm","slug":"golden-palm","genreTag":false,"subgenreTag":false,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:1041.tags.3":{"name":"Palme d'Or winner (Cannes Film Festival)","slug":"palme-dor-winner","genreTag":false,"subgenreTag":false,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:1968":{"id":1968,"name":"The Breakfast Club ","slug":"the-breakfast-club-1985","year":1985,"hasCover":true,"poster":"https:\u002F\u002Fcbs-static.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fstatic\u002Fmedia\u002Fposters\u002F1968\u002F1968-tmdb.jpg","isBookmarked":false,"isFaved":false,"viewerRating":null,"coverPoster":"https:\u002F\u002Fcbs-static.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fstatic\u002Fmedia\u002Fposters\u002F1968\u002Fcover\u002F1968-cover.jpg","summary":"Beyond being in the same class at Shermer High School in Shermer, Illinois, Claire Standish, Andrew Clark, John Bender, Brian Johnson and Allison Reynolds have little in common, and with the exception of Claire and Andrew, do not associate with each other in school. In the simplest and in their own terms, Claire is a princess, Andrew an athlete, John a criminal, Brian a brain, and Allison a basket case. But one other thing they do have in common is a nine hour detention in the school library together on Saturday, March 24, 1984, under the direction of Mr. Vernon, supervising from his office across the hall. Each is required to write a minimum one thousand word essay during that time about who they think they are. At the beginning of those nine hours, each, if they were indeed planning on writing that essay, would probably write something close to what the world sees of them, and what they have been brainwashed into believing of themselves. But based on their adventures during that nine hours, they may come to a different opinion of themselves and the other four.","imdbRating":7.9,"tags":[{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:1968.tags.0","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:1968.tags.1","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:1968.tags.2","typename":"TagType"},{"type":"id","generated":true,"id":"MovieType:1968.tags.3","typename":"TagType"}],"__typename":"MovieType"},"MovieType:1968.tags.0":{"name":"comedy","slug":"comedy","genreTag":true,"subgenreTag":false,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:1968.tags.1":{"name":"drama","slug":"drama","genreTag":true,"subgenreTag":false,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:1968.tags.2":{"name":"social commentary","slug":"social-commentary","genreTag":false,"subgenreTag":true,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:1968.tags.3":{"name":"teen movie","slug":"teen-movie","genreTag":true,"subgenreTag":false,"__typename":"TagType"},"MovieType:100714":{"id":100714,"name":"Before Midnight ","slug":"before-midnight-2013","year":2013,"hasCover":true,"poster":"https:\u002F\u002Fcbs-static.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fstatic\u002Fmedia\u002Fposters\u002F100714\u002F100714-tmdb.jpg","isBookmarked":false,"isFaved":false,"viewerRating":null,"coverPoster":"https:\u002F\u002Fcbs-static.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fstatic\u002Fmedia\u002Fposters\u002F100714\u002Fcover\u002F100714-cover.jpg","summary":"It has been nine years since we last met Jesse and Celine, the French-American couple who once met on a train in Vienna.
