Some films come to the fore with their rich dialogues without compromising their visual and audio values.There are even some that a whole film is almost exclusively among people in a room. Sometimes the dialogue itself can be very striking, and sometimes dialogues step by step forms a great narrative.</p><p class="sc-kpOJdX ilifeO" font-size="14,16,16,18">We collected movies that that focus primarily on rich dialogues. In <em>Perfect Strangers</em>, friendship of old friends are reviewed. In <em>God on Trial</em><strong> , </strong>God<strong> </strong>will be 'judged' in a concentrations camp by the prisoners. In The trilogy of <em>Before Sunrise</em>, <em>Before Sunset</em> and <em>Before Midnight</em><strong> </strong>which are filmed in 20 years, we witness the dialogue between a woman and a man. In <em>The Seventh Seal</em>, we follow the conversation between a knight and the Death who came for him, and the existentialist perspective of Ingmar Bergman. <em>12 Angry Men</em> have an 8.9 IMDb points examined crime, punishment and prejudice and becomes one of the masterpieces in the history of cinema.</p><p class="sc-kpOJdX ilifeO" font-size="14,16,16,18">Thie movie list we curated is naturally excludes many great instances.
